Code sample for Wikimedia Foundation.

Class to convert amounts of money between different currencies, and to maintain a local store of exchange rates provided by a third party.

Rounds to correct number of decimal places for output currency.

Given one conversion rate between currencies, can convert both ways.  Not implemented, but might be fun: finding a conversion path between two currencies when no explicit rate is given.

Not yet implemented: limiting age of acceptable rates, batching db queries for array conversion.
